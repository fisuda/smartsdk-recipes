## Introduction
This repository is part of the [SmartSDK](http://smartsdk.eu/) project and contains recipes to use different [FIWARE Generic Enablers](https://catalogue.fiware.org) to develop FIWARE-based applications.

For more info, refer to the _readme.md_ of each subfolder or directly to the **[docs](https://smartsdk.github.io/smartsdk-recipes/)**.


## Requirements

The only requirement is to have [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) (version >= 1.13).
Installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).


## How to use

Having git and docker installed, simply run:

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/smartsdk/smartsdk-recipes.git

Then navigate through the directories or the docs to get more details about the recipes of your interest.

Checkout the **[tools](https://github.com/smartsdk/smartsdk-recipes/tree/master/recipes/tools)** section for instructions on how to create a docker swarm cluster locally to test the recipes.

## Documentation

For now we are using [Mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org) deploying on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), but we might change to [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org) to keep aligned with most of FIWARE GEs.

You will also notice that instead of having a separate _docs_ folder, the documentation is composed of the README's content of all subfolders so as to keep docs as close to the respective recipes as possible.


###### Updating docs
If you change the structure of the index or add new pages, remember to update _mkdocs.yml_ accordingly.
Then run:

    $ mkdocs gh-deploy


## TO-DO
- Automatic docs updates (consider readthedocs with webhooks)
- Create a how-to-contribute section
